## About Me

I'm a **Computer Science graduate student** at the **University of California, Santa Cruz**, with a passion for building scalable software solutions, specializing in **Python**, **C++**, **SQL**, and **JavaScript**. I have a strong foundation in **full-stack development**, with expertise in **React.js**, **Flask**, and deploying applications on **AWS** using **Docker**. My technical background also includes **CI/CD pipelines**, **machine learning**, and **data structures & algorithms**.

I believe in creating well-documented, efficient solutions that address real-world problems. My journey as a developer has always been about learning, experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible through code.

## 🔧 What I Do

### Machine Learning & AI
I actively work on **machine learning projects** using frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**. From real-time systems to image recognition tasks, I enjoy applying **deep learning models** to practical use cases and improving them for real-world performance.

### DevOps & Cloud
Cloud deployments and **CI/CD pipelines** are central to my workflow. I deploy applications on **AWS** and containerize them using **Docker** for scalability and efficiency. I enjoy automating processes using tools like **Jenkins** and **Git**, streamlining the deployment and testing phases.

### Documentation & Open-Source
I emphasize clear, organized documentation using **LaTeX** and **Notion**. Whether it's writing research papers or maintaining a clean project structure, I believe in making my work accessible and understandable to others.
