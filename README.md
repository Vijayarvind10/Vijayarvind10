<div class="github-introduction">

I'm a **Software Engineer and Researcher**, passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology. With a **strong foundation in computer science** and expertise in areas like **machine learning, network security, and real-time systems**, I am always driven to solve complex problems that matter.

Having a background as both a **research intern** at **Samsung R&D** and **IIT Indore**, I‚Äôve honed my skills in building secure and scalable systems. My projects span from **advanced user authentication systems** to **real-time stress detection frameworks** and **weapon detection using deep learning models**.

Currently, I‚Äôm exploring **AI-powered automation**, DevOps tools, and deploying **cross-platform applications**. With a mix of **Python, C++, and JavaScript**, I build solutions that are not just functional but efficient and secure. I also thrive in **competitive hackathons**, having earned top positions in several national competitions.
